I had never heard of the Game Of Life until recently, so I got curious and decided to implement it.

(using rust, btw)

## What is gameoflife?
The game of life is a game that simulates the evolution of a population of cells. The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

Further information can be found on the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
